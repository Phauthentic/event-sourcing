# Other Event Sourcing Libraries

If you don't like this library, you might get happy with one of those. We think that different libraries for the same purpose approach the same problem from different angles and probably for different skill levels and audiences. Therefor we are happy to provide you with a list of alternatives.

It would be nice if you could tell us why you preferred another library, thank you!

## [Event Sauce](https://eventsauce.io/)     

A wide used an well know library.

## [Prooph Event Sourcing](https://github.com/prooph/event-sourcing) 

A very well engineered library, but it seems to be unmaintained. Some might even call it over-engineered, however it is a very good library.

## [Patchlevel Event Sourcing](https://github.com/patchlevel/event-sourcing)

A library that is very tightly coupled with Symfony and Doctrine. It has a lot of dependencies and is not as flexible as the other libraries.
